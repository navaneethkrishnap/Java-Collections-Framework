# Java Collections Framework Learning

This repository is dedicated to my learning and practice of the **Java Collections Framework (JCF)**.  
Here, I explore different collections, their features, and how to use them effectively in Java programs.  

## What you will find here
- Examples of **List**, **Set**, **Map**, and **Queue** implementations
- Practice problems and solutions using collections
- Notes on differences, performance, and usage of various collection types

## Purpose
The main goal of this repo is to **learn, practice, and document** JCF concepts while building small examples and exercises.
